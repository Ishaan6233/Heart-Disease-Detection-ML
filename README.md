# Heart-Disease-Detection-ML
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. By utilizing various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost, we strive to create an accurate and reliable predictive model. The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease Dataset (Comprehensive) from IEEE Dataport.
